This file configures AI coding assistants for the Apple monorepo.
Development rules are maintained in `.cursor/rules/` as the single source of truth.

**Personal preferences** (workflow, communication style, tool settings) belong in
your tool's user-level config, not here:
- Claude Code: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- Cursor: User-level settings

This repo-level file is for **team-shared conventions only**.

## Rules
